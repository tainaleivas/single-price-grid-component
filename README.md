## Overview

### The challenge
Challenge is to build out this pricing component and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- See a hover state on desktop for the Sign Up call-to-action

## My process
Let's say that my development process for this project, although simple, gave me headaches because I've never written HTML without using a lot of divs hahahahaha. Not even some css with specific media rules for mobile. However, it was fun and I understood that even a simple layout requires attention to the details to make it work as well as possible on mobile devices.

...css is awesome. ![](giphy.gif)

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to build semantic html after a period of time without any enthusiasm. It's part of life that we're not always 100% and that's ok! :smile:
It was rewarding to write simple media rules and understand how they are applied to make the layout perform better. This made me see layout development in a different way as it was built prioritizing mobile first. It was fun!
